== Description ==

OccasionWise is a site dedicated to Occasions, Observances and Events and lets its users know all about holidays and events through its own website, on Facebook and through usage of its very own API.

The WordPress OccasionWise Calendar Plugin will allow users to quickly insert the OccasionWise Calendar into their WordPress Blog sidebar.

The calendar not only keeps its readers up to date with global occasions, events and observances but also allows its users to add up to 10 other feeds so as to show the users own blog postings and social networking by displaying their friends blog feeds and any other compatible feeds that the OccasionWise API supports.

(Currently supports 'WordPress' and 'BBC on this Day' and will soon support Google Calendar and Blogger)

Technical Details

The OccasionWise Calendar can be inserted into any website or blog by simply pasting a few lines of javascript into a page - the WordPress Plugin will make integration easier and will be available as a widget.

The OccasionWise API is hosted on dedicated professional servers that are scalable to cope with demand - The users calendar is rendered on these servers and made available to the users website via the use of API calls and AJAX/JSON (we term as AJON for cross domain usage)

The OccasionWise Calendar is fully customisable - It comes with a default CSS style and more preset styles will be available soon. These can be disabled to allow users Full control or redesigning the CSS.

The OccasionWise Calendar is the first of its kind to use fade in / fade out tooltips and popover dialog boxes to display its data.
